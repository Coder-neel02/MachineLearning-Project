1. Problem Definition
Objective: Develop a system that recommends movies similar to a user-selected movie based on certain features like genre, ratings, and more.
Target Audience: Movie enthusiasts and users looking for personalized movie recommendations.
2. Data Collection
Data Source: Obtain a dataset of movies with various features (e.g., title, genre, ratings) from publicly available sources like Kaggle or directly from The Movie Database (TMDb).
API Integration: Set up access to the TMDb API to fetch additional movie details like posters, which will enhance the user experience.
3. Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features (e.g., genre, keywords, cast) that will be used to calculate movie similarity.
Vectorization: Convert textual data (e.g., genres, plot keywords) into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Count Vectorization.
4. Similarity Matrix Construction
Cosine Similarity: Calculate the similarity between movies using cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two non-zero vectors. This will help in determining how similar two movies are based on selected features.
Similarity Matrix: Construct a similarity matrix where each entry represents the similarity score between two movies.
5. Model Building
Recommendation Function: Create a function that, given a movie title, will:
Find the movie's index in the dataset.
Retrieve the similarity scores for that movie.
Sort the scores in descending order to identify the most similar movies.
Fetch the corresponding movie titles and their posters.
6. User Interface Development
Framework Selection: Use Streamlit, an open-source app framework, to build the user interface.
UI Components:
Dropdown Menu: Implement a dropdown menu to allow users to select a movie.
Recommendation Display: Design the layout to display recommended movie titles and their posters in a visually appealing manner using Streamlit columns.
Image Carousel: Integrate an image carousel to display selected movie posters interactively, enhancing the user experience.
7. Integration with TMDb API
Poster Fetching: Write a function to fetch movie posters from the TMDb API using the movie's unique ID.
Error Handling: Ensure the application handles errors, such as missing posters or API request failures, gracefully.
8. Testing and Debugging
Functionality Testing: Test each component of the application individually, ensuring that the recommendation function, API integration, and UI components work as expected.
User Testing: Conduct user testing to gather feedback on usability and the accuracy of recommendations.
9. Deployment
Streamlit Sharing: Deploy the application using Streamlit Sharing or other cloud platforms like Heroku to make the app accessible to users.
Version Control: Use Git for version control, ensuring that all project files are managed effectively and changes are tracked.
10. Documentation
Code Documentation: Write clear and concise comments within the code to explain the functionality of each part.
User Guide: Create a user guide that explains how to use the application, including any prerequisites and instructions for running the app locally.
11. Presentation and Reporting
Project Report: Compile a comprehensive report detailing the objectives, methodologies, results, and conclusions of the project.
Presentation: Prepare a presentation to showcase the project, focusing on the technical aspects, societal impact, and potential future improvements.
12. Future Work
Scalability: Explore ways to scale the system to handle more data and provide faster recommendations.
Enhancements: Consider integrating more sophisticated recommendation algorithms (e.g., collaborative filtering) and adding user-specific preferences to refine recommendations further.
